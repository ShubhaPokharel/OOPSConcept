# OOPSConcept

OOPS

Java is a class-based object-oriented programming language.
OOPS helps to create well structured programs.
 It uses objects to show data. It lets us create methods and variables and we can reuse them.
OOPS is organizing and developing the programs.It removes conventional programming methods. It modularizes the code. The main objective of object-oriented programming is to increase the readability, flexibility and maintainability of java code.  Java, C++, Python, C#, Perl, JavaScript, Ruby, Smalltalk etc, are popular programming languages which are supported by OOPS.

Features of OOPS:

1 - OOPS is faster and easier to execute the code. 

2 - It provides a clear structure for the programs.

3 - OOPS helps the java code DRY. DRY stands for “Don’t repeat yourself”.It makes the code easier to maintain and debug.

4 -  OOPS makes it possible to reuse applications with less code and short timing. 

5 - External functions cannot access it because the data is hidden.

6 - New methods and data can be easily added whenever necessary.

7 - Objects communicate with each other through methods.
